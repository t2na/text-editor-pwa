# text-editor-pwa

A text editor application that functions as a progressive web app.

### Description
The following documentation is for the nineteenth challenge of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to build out the requisite JavaScript files for a text editor PWA app - one that is downloadable and can run offline.

The project gave me experience working with the popular webpack plugin, which is used to bundle important file components and allow your browser to more easily and seemlessly run your code. Additionally, it allowed me to get comfortable with modern application paradigms that allow PWA apps to run successfully, such as service-workers, webpack configs, and the client/server file structure.

### Installation
In order to use the application, clone the GitHub repository link and start the application using node.

### Usage
This application is free to use.

### Credits
This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors, TAs, and my tutor (Erik Hirsch) from UC Berkeley.
